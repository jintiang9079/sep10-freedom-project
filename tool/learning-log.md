## Tool: CSS Variable

---

### 3/12/25:
* I learned how to use Variable to re-use it somewhere again without wasting time on it to code it again.  
* It's such as first you put ```main-company-color: green;``` then you'd be able to use this color with variable by doing this ```color: var(main-company-color);```
* I tried these in [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output)
* It worked out pretty well, but I'm going to find more useful tech's with this.

### 3/23/25:
* I learned that variables could also be used for bootstrap components.
* Like for cards ```card-padding: 20px;``` and you do ``` padding: var(--card-padding);```.
* I tried these in [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output)
* I am currently still exploring for more use with CSS Variables, but I've already got a decent amount of the whole concept of CSS Variables.

### 3/27/25:
* As I've have exceeded the learning of CSS Variables, I'll be learning Aframes as my secondary tool in my Freedom Project now.
* To access the Aframes you must input ```<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.7.0/aframe.min.js"></script>```, this will allow the website to read the script and access the aframe.
* To create a scene for objects, you must use ```<a-scene>```, this will allow aframes to create a scene that will hold all the objects for aframes.
* You can create shapes by using these codes: ```<a-box>  <a-sphere>  <a-cylinder>  <a-plane> <a-sky>```, this will create objects.
* You can do a lot of things with the objects using these codes: ```position=”” rotation=”” color=”” radius=”” height=”” width=””```.

### 4/20/25:
* I learnt how to minimize aframe instead of it taking full screen space.
* I learnt that stuff within aframe is all in html.

## Tool: CSS Variable

---

### 3/12/25:
* I learned how to use Variable to re-use it somewhere again without wasting time on it to code it again.  
* It's such as first you put ```main-company-color: green;``` then you'd be able to use this color with variable by doing this ```color: var(main-company-color);```
* I tried these in [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output)
* It worked out pretty well, but I'm going to find more useful tech's with this.

|William   |I like the background for the title; it seems very nice with the white text and the border.   |When you tap the navbar icon, have you considered changing "Part A", "Part B" and "Aframe" to something about the information present in each section? Also, what if the person reading the website doesn't know what AFrame is? Other than that, at a bigger screen size, have you considered making the images go side-by-side?
| Rain Song  | Since I'm also using A-Frame tool, I like how you attached the scene onto the website instead of linking via creating a new html file  | Try adding more bootstrap components, if possible and also more responsive.
| Abdelrahman | I like the 3D Model, it looks very cool, and the embedded version is just the cherry on top! | I think you should make use of colors more, especially in text. I think it'll make your website more pleasing to the eyes instead of just one color.
|Winnie|I like the cool wave background on the top part. The dsign is really cool. I also like the font and that quote you used.I also like the 3D model you placed on the bottom. it look very cool and it seems like a nice design.|A suggestion would be to add like bootstrap component like cards.

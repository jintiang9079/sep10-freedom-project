|William   |I like the background for the title; it seems very nice with the white text and the border.   |When you tap the navbar icon, have you considered changing "Part A", "Part B" and "Aframe" to something about the information present in each section? Also, what if the person reading the website doesn't know what AFrame is? Other than that, at a bigger screen size, have you considered making the images go side-by-side?
| Rain Song  | Since I'm also using A-Frame tool, I like how you attached the scene onto the website instead of linking via creating a new html file  | Try adding more bootstrap components, if possible and also more responsive.

In this blog, I will discuss what takeaways I gained after my **Expo elevator pitch** and **in-class presentation** of my **Freedom Project**.  
  
First, I presented my freedom project to 9th, 11th and 12th graders during my Expo. While I was presenting my I realized how presenting to others in-person isn't scary at all. And I gained tons of **valuable skills** from presenting to others, such as gaining **confidence** and learning how to **communicate** more clearly for them to understand me better.  

Second, I presented my freedom project to my Software Engineering Class in-person, our teacher made us go one by one and gave us advices on how could we make our presentation better afterwards. I have gained tons of valuable tips from my teacher, such as making a **good hook is really important as it will draw people's attention**, explain **how did I code a ceterin component**, do **more eye contacts**, go **deeper into takeaways**, more **details**.

To present my project to others during the Expo, I've created a document first, planning what to say generally, and then doing an official paragraph by combining the general pieces of information I'm going to be saying.

I've created a slide presentation for my in-class presentation for the audience to know what's going on.

# EDP
During this blog, I've learnt how to:  
- Plan my presentations
- Present with confidence
- Eye contact

To be better at presenting to others in-person and online, I would ask people for tips and try to present random projects to my friends to increase my confidence.
# Skill
Since my last blog, I've learnt **new skills**, two skills I've learnt are:  
- Planning how to present
- How to present in front of others  
Basically, planning a presentation was a bit difficult as you have to include a hook and details on how I managed to do my project, but I learnt how to plan after my presentation in class, and my teacher gave me tips on how I could do it better.
And presenting in front of others required me a lot of courage, I did it though because it was required but after me presenting in front of others I realized that it wasn't that hard and I then presented with confidence and I believe I will continue to do so in the future.

# Content
Since my blog post 2, I've been thinking about how technology can help artists reach their next step. I've been developing ideas that could help Art generally for beginners and experts. I started by looking through other people's websites on art technology which have inspired many ideas in this blog I'm creating.
# Sources
The website I used for inspiration was made by another student in the SEP program.  
https://simrans4258.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/  
This website provides all the current technology and software that help people create art.
# EDP
In this blog, I've researched websites and came up with ideas such as a **pencil** which contains multiple features, and a **robot** which helps the person to learn how to draw, giving tips, etc. The next step I'd take would be taking these ideas and turning them into a more specific thing.
# Skills
In this blog, I've learned how to **research** more properly as I now know how to be more careful about how I google things and how I double-check stuff with the internet.

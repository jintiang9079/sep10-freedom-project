For the tool I chose for my freedom project, it would be CSS Variables, CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. I tinkered with these tools by using them myself, in websites like jsbin, etc. I used them to make columns and customized.  
For example, here's one of the jsbin I did:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>JS Bin</title>
  <style>
    .container {
      display: flex;
      gap: 10px;
      background-color: yellow;
      padding: 20px;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }

    .box {
      width: 50px;
      height: 50px;
      background-color: white;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      border: 2px solid black;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="box">1</div>
    <div class="box">2</div>
    <div class="box">3</div>
  </div>

</body>
</html>

```
# Sources
For the soruces I used to complete the tinkering, I used the resources of "[W3Schools](www.w3schools.com)" to learn about CSS Variables, CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox as it contains the learning strategies to help me. To test the lines of codes I've learned on [W3Schools](www.w3schools.com), I used the website "[JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output)", this website allows me to uses the knowledge I learnt and input it in here to see if I truly understand it.
# Skills
In this blog, I've learnt how to test my knowledge myself when I learn something properly, and also how to know if a website tool is right for me to use.

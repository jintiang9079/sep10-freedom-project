<h1> Topics </h1>


My topic that I decided on will be about [**Art**](https://www.art.com/), the backup topics will be [**Law Enforcement**](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/services/law-enforcement/law-enforcement-landing.page) and [**teaching**](https://teachingstrategies.com/).


<h1> Engineering Design Process </h1>


I am still currently in the stage of looking for an goal for art, but here's my current goal, I want people to **learn art more easily**, I would have an **visual** teaching, tracing, etc.


<h1> Skills </h1>


Skills that I learnt from working on this blog are **more coding**, **how to ask for help** and **how to make notes**.


<h3> Coding: </h3>
I've learnt how to code in HTML and more markdowns.


<h3> Asking for help: </h3>
I've learnt how to ask others for help and how I should google to help myself with coding.


<h3> How to make more better notes: </h3>
I've learnt to use bullet points to make more clear and instructive notes, which really helped me in coding better.

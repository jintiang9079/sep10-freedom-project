# Context
Since my blog 1, I've started researching Art hardware devices. I've found many websites regarding this research, such as [21Draw](https://www.21-draw.com/digital-art-setup-guide/ ), which offers good hardware devices for students.
# Content
I've found [21Draw](https://www.21-draw.com/digital-art-setup-guide/ ) by googling up "Art hardware devices" which gave me the website, and [21Draw](https://www.21-draw.com/digital-art-setup-guide/ ) have provided me a list of hardware devices that are helpful to beginners or experts.
# Sources
### Source #1: [21Draw](https://www.21-draw.com/digital-art-setup-guide/ ) list of hardware devices:
- Wacom
- Huion
- Apple (iPad)
- Microsoft
 
These hardware devices are all great equipment for beginners in drawing arts as they provide the necessary features to start the journey of drawing. 

# EDP
In this blog, the steps of the engineering design process I took were researching the topic I am on. The next step of my blog should be thinking about how would I be using the source I listed to help me in the Freedom's project.

# Skills
Since my last blog, I've been working on my **time management** and **planning**. These two skills mattered the most to me as I needed to know when should I start doing my work and how should I do my work. Time management has helped me improve in stopping missing work and doing my homework, projects, etc all on time. And planning has helped me to have a better idea of what to do in the future of my projects which saves me a lot of time.
